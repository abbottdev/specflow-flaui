# Tasks

 1. Fix the code so you can evaluate the result of the first SpecFlow test
    *(Here's a handy tool to find automation information about an already running app: https://github.com/FlauTech/FlaUInspect)* 
    
 2. Make the calculator automation accept input for all numbers (0-9) instead of just number 1 
    
 3. Write a new specflow test that checks the condition "2 + 1 = 3"
  
 4. Write a new specflow test that checks the condition "2 - 1 = 1"
  
 5. Write a new specflow test that checks the condition "1.5 + 1.5 = 3"
